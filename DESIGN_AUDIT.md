### **1. Login/Connecting Wallets**

**Observation:**
Yesterday we added the account linking and the possibillity to connect wallets, Metamask and Solana wallets like Phantom. I tried to connect both but got several problems.
1. - at the Ethereum wallet (Metamask) i get this error: 'Provider not found. Version: @wagmi/core@2.19.0'-, testet on mobile and desktop (Chrome and Safari, strangely on BRAVE desktop it lets me choose Metamask or Phantom, and it opens both, i logged in with Phantom and got connected to the Ethereum chain...).
2. - at the Solana wallet it says: 'Please select a Solana wallet and try again.' , but how to connect is not specified, nor can i choose any wallet. Testet on mobile. On desktop, Chrome and Safari, it says 'Could not connect to Solana wallet.', On Brave it works, see point 1.
3. - In mobile phone Brave browser, i have the wallet sign in the address line, but that wants connect to the Brave wallet, which we don't have as a possible wallet to connect to, and it does ot connect to Metamask or Phantom, see point 1 and 2.


**Weird as Fuck**

We had this issue before, but on Brave Desktop, the website is broken, no margins, some cards like the token card in Dashboard is missing, some actual design changes it has got, but others not, it still has the mobile hamburger menu icon instead of the normal nav, but when i open the hamburger menu there is no nav, its empty. I navigated to (https://www.made-in-haiphong.com/dashboard/settings) by copying the path from the chrome browser window to get there and connect the wallet. I wiped cache and all data possible already, still the same shit, though, the wallet stuff is working there...
